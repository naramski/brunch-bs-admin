# Brunch Bootstrap Admin

This is an adaptation of the template sb-admin (https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-sb-admin), using brunch (http://brunch.io/) as a build tool

## Download and Installation

To begin using this template:

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/naramski/brunch-bs-admin.git`
* npm install
* brunch build --production

The template is then compiled in `public` folder

## Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
